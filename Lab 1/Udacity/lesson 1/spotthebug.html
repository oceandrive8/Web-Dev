<!--Consider each of the following chunks of HTML. Which are formatted incorrectly? That is, which ones look wrong and need their HTML corrected?-->
1. <p>a paragraph<p>
    Improperly formatted(cause we need to close the tag)

2. <p><em>words, words, wrods.</em></p>
    Looks great!

3. <span...middle of the sentence...</span>
    Improperly formatted(cause after <span we have to close it)

4. <p><em>words, words, wrods.</p></em>
    Improperly formatted(cause tag </em> is outside)
