/* result is modified between assertions, making tests dependent on execution order.
If one test fails, it affects the next one, since result is updated dynamically.
Not structured properly for unit testing, as all cases are inside a single it block instead of separate ones.
It would be much better to break the test into multiple it blocks with clearly written inputs and outputs.*/
